# Hello, I'm David Njoroge Kairu, but you can call me David!
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm thrilled to have you here. Let me introduce myself.

## About Me
I'm a student double majoring in Math and CS with a passion for problem solving, previously only a Math Major. 
Added the CS Major after taking the intro class for fun spring semester of Sophomore year and realized its something i actually enjoyed.
I enjoy playing tennis and working out.
When I'm not coding, you can find me in the gym doing calisthenics or powerlifting].

## What You'll Find Here
On this GitHub, you'll discover a variety of projects that reflect my interests and expertise. 
I'm constantly learning and experimenting,and still in my early coding journey so you might stumble upon repositories related to DSA, and basic intro stuff.
